# Dan Sullivan

Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer specializing in building scalable systems and intelligent applications.

## About Me

I'm a senior-level engineer with extensive experience in Javascript, TypeScript, and modern web technologies, currently seeking opportunities at innovative startups and quantitative investment firms where I can contribute to complex technical challenges while expanding my expertise in emerging technologies.

My background spans full-stack development, API architecture, and production-grade system design. I'm particularly drawn to roles where engineering excellence directly impacts business outcomes, whether that's building trading infrastructure, developing data-intensive platforms, or creating tools that enable better decision-making.

## Recent Technical Work

**Alternative Data Intelligence Dashboard** – Built a production-ready financial analysis platform over a weekend for a hedge fund interview, featuring natural language query parsing, automated price predictor discovery, and comprehensive authentication systems. The application demonstrates rapid prototyping capabilities while maintaining production-quality code standards and security practices.

**Model Context Protocol Integration** – Exploring cutting-edge AI integration patterns through ATXP payment systems work, investigating how to build robust interfaces between language models and external systems for real-world applications.

**Machine Learning Research** – Actively developing reinforcement learning and fine-tuning implementations to deepen my understanding of how modern AI systems learn and adapt, with a focus on practical applications in prediction and decision-making systems.

## Technical Expertise

My core strengths include Javascript backend development, TypeScript and JavaScript for full-stack applications, Express API design, and modern React frameworks including Next.js. I have significant experience with distributed systems concepts, database architecture, and building secure authentication systems.

I'm currently expanding my capabilities in machine learning implementation, reinforcement learning techniques, and advanced integration patterns for AI-powered applications. I believe the most impactful engineering work happens at the intersection of solid fundamentals and emerging technologies.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking senior engineering positions where I can contribute immediately while continuing to grow technically. The ideal role involves complex system design challenges, opportunities to work with quantitative or financial data, and a team culture that values both engineering excellence and rapid innovation.

I'm particularly interested in environments where engineers have significant ownership over architecture decisions and where there's exposure to cutting-edge technologies that push the boundaries of what's possible in software development.

## Background

Former Division 1 varsity athlete who brings the same discipline and competitive drive to software engineering that I brought to athletics. I approach technical challenges with a methodical, results-oriented mindset and thrive in environments that demand both precision and creativity.

When I'm not coding, I maintain an active interest sports, enjoy building custom applications for personal projects including fantasy sports analytics and recipe generation, and continuously explore new technologies through hands-on experimentation.
